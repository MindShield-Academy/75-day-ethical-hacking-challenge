# Day 3 - Networking Fundamentals

## Key Topics Covered:

### What is Networking?
Networking involves connecting multiple computers and devices to share resources and information. It's the backbone of modern communication, allowing devices to communicate and exchange data.

### What is the Internet?
The Internet is a global network of interconnected computers that communicate through a standardized set of protocols. It enables access to information, communication, and services across the world.

### Network Devices:

- **Switch:** A switch is a device that connects multiple devices on a local network and uses MAC addresses to forward data to the correct destination.
- **Router:** Routers connect different networks and direct data packets between them. They use IP addresses to determine the best path for data transmission.
- **Hub:** A hub is a basic networking device that connects multiple Ethernet devices. It broadcasts data to all connected devices, regardless of the intended recipient.

### IP Address:
An IP address is a unique identifier assigned to each device on a network. It allows devices to locate and communicate with each other over the Internet.

### MAC Address:
A MAC address is a hardware identifier assigned to network interfaces. It uniquely identifies a device on a local network and is used by switches to forward data.

### ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol):
ICMP is used for diagnostic and error-reporting purposes. It helps manage and control the flow of data in a network by sending messages about network conditions.

### Types of Networks:

- **LAN (Local Area Network):** Covers a small geographic area, like a home or office.
- **WAN (Wide Area Network):** Covers a large geographic area, connecting multiple LANs, such as the Internet.
- **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network):** Spans a city or a large campus.

### Network Topology:
The layout or arrangement of devices in a network. Common topologies include star, bus, ring, and mesh, each with its advantages and disadvantages.
